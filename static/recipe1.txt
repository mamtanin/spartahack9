(Orange Chicken Penne Pasta Salad)

(Ingredients)
- 1 Grilled Chicken Breast
- 300g Penne Pasta
- 1 Tomato 
- 2 Carrots
- 1 Orange
- 1 Lettuce
- 2 tbsp of Soy Sauce
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tsp of Italian herbs mix (or a mix of dried basil, oregano, rosemary)
- Olive oil 

(Steps)
1. Start by cooking the Penne Pasta. Boil a pot of water, add salt to taste and then add the pasta. Cook it until itâ€™s al dente, drain it and keep it aside. 

2. While pasta is cooking, prepare your vegetables. Wash and chop the tomato and carrots into small chunks, then wash and tear off lettuce leaves to bite-sized pieces.

3. Grate the zest from the orange and then squeeze out the juice. Keep both aside separately.

4. Slice your grilled chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.

5. Now, heat a pan over medium heat and add a dash of olive oil. Once it's hot, add in your chopped grilled chicken breast.

6. Once chicken is slightly golden, add in the carrots and saute for 5 minutes. 

7. Next, add the tomato and saute until it gets soft.

8. Now, add the cooked Penne Pasta to the pan. Mix it well and make sure the pasta is integrated with chicken and vegetables.

9. Now is the time to flavor. Add the Soy Sauce, orange zest, Italian herbs (or your dried herbs mix), salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything well, letting it cook for 2-3 more minutes so the pasta absorbs the flavor.

10. Finally, add squeezed orange juice to the pan and stir well. Remove the pan from heat.

11. In a serving bowl, spread out the lettuce leaves, and pour your warm pasta salad on top.
