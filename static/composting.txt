Composting is a great way to recycle leftover foods, transforming waste into nutrient-rich soil for your garden. Here's the breakdown based on your ingredients:

Good for composting:
1. Carrots
2. Tomato 
3. Oranges
4. Lettuce
5. Rice
6. Penne Pasta

These ingredients are all organic matter that can break down naturally without causing harm to the environment.

Here’s what should not go into compost:
1. Soy Sauce – It's high in salt, which can be harmful to the composting process and plants.
2. Grilled Chicken Breast and Hamburger Patties – They can attract pests and cause bad odors during decomposing.
3. French Fries – Often they have too much oil and salt.
4. Orange Chicken – The sauces and oils from this meal can disrupt the balance of the compost pile and attract pests.

Here's a simple way to turn your compostable food leftovers into compost:

1. Start your compost pile on bare ground. This allows worms and other beneficial organisms to aerate the compost and be transported to your garden beds.
   
2. Lay twigs or straw first, few inches deep. This aids in drainage and helps aerate the pile.
   
3. Add compost materials in layers, alternating moist and dry. The moist ingredients are the food scraps and tea bags, and dry materials are straw, leaves, sawdust pellets, and wood ashes.
  
4. Add green manure (clover, buckwheat, wheatgrass, grass clippings) or any nitrogen source. This activates the compost pile and accelerates the process.
   
5. Keep compost moist. Water it occasionally, or let rain do the job.

6. Cover with wood, plastic sheeting, carpet scraps. This helps retain moisture and heat, two essentials for compost.

7. Turn the compost pile every few weeks with a pitchfork or shovel. This helps to aerate the pile and speeds the process of composting.

It generally takes 2-3 months for compost to get ready if managed well, or 1-2 years if left unattended. The compost is ready when it becomes a black, rich, crumbly material with a sweet earthy smell. You can then incorporate it into your garden soil.
